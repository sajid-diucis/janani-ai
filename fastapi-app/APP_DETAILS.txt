CORE FEATURES & LOGIC
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Digital Midwife (Voice Triage)
- Deterministic Triage: Uses a complex decision tree based on WHO protocols to detect "Red Flag" symptoms (e.g., bleeding, severe headache, vision changes).
- Dialect Support: Specially tuned for Bengali, including regional dialects like Noakhali. It uses phonological shift rules to understand and respond in local dialects.
- Voice-First: Integrated STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) for hands-free interaction.

2. Weekly Care Planner
- Personalized Development: Tracks baby and mother changes week-by-week.
- WHO Guidelines: Recommendations for nutrition, safe exercise, and medical checkups are dynamically generated based on the patient's trimester.
- Risk-Adjusted: Automatically adjusts advice based on the user's risk profile (age, BMI, pre-existing conditions).

3. AR Emergency Labor Assistant
- Offline-First: Uses MediaPipe WASM to run camera-based AI directly in the browser without needing internet.
- Real-time Guidance: Provides step-by-step AR protocols for emergency delivery situations when medical help is unavailable.

4. Nutrition & Food (RAG + Vision)
- AI Food Analysis: Users can upload photos of food or ask questions. The app uses Vision AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to check if the food is safe and beneficial according to pregnancy guidelines.
- Recommendation Engine: Provides personalized diet plans.

5. Medical Document Support
- Document Parsing: Agents and users can upload .docx or .doc medical reports. The system extracts medical history to build a precise risk profile.
