      "raw_text_snippet": "This example profile illustrates a complex case involving a pregnant woman in her second trimester (13–27 weeks) who is managing Iron Deficiency Anemia alongside other common but serious co-existing conditions.\nPatient Profile: Example Case Study\n1. Basic Information\nPatient Name: Mrs. J. Rahman\nAge: 29 years old\nGestational Age: 22 Weeks (Second Trimester)\nPregnancy Status: G2P1 (Second pregnancy, one previous birth)\n2. Clinical Diagnoses\nBeyond the primary concern of pregnancy, the patient presents with a \"comorbidity triad\":\nIron Deficiency Anemia (Moderate): Hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL (Normal for 2nd trimester is $>10.5$ g/dL).\nGestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM): Diagnosed via Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 20 weeks.\nChronic Hypertension: High blood pressure predating the pregnancy, currently managed with medication.\n3. Symptom Checklist\nMrs. Rahman reports the following symptoms, which are a mix of pregnancy changes and her specific diseases:\nAnemia Related: Persistent fatigue, shortness of breath during light walks, and occasional dizziness (vertigo).\nGDM Related: Increased thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination beyond the usual pregnancy frequency.\nHypertension Related: Occasional mild headaches and slight swelling (edema) in the ankles.\n4. Vital Signs & Lab Data\n5. Management Plan\nBecause she has multiple diseases, her care requires a balanced approach to ensure treatments for one condition don't worsen another:\nFor Anemia: * Oral Iron Supplements (Ferrous Fumarate) 200mg twice daily.\nVitamin C supplementation to increase iron absorption.\nCaution: Iron can cause constipation, which is already a risk in the 2nd trimester.1\nFor Gestational Diabetes: * A strict low-glycemic index (Low-GI) diet.\nMonitoring blood glucose 4 times a day (fasting and after meals).\nFor Hypertension: * Prescribed Labetalol (a pregnancy-safe beta-blocker).2\nLow-sodium diet.\nFetal Monitoring: * Monthly growth scans (Ultrasounds) to ensure the baby is growing correctly desp",
